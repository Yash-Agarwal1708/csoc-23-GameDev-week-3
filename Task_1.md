## Task 1
Create a pixel art barrel that would fit a pirate game. The barrel should fit into a 32x32 pixel size although it can be smaller. 
You should use no more than 15 colors. Then import the barrel sprite into Unity, place it in a scene, and take a screenshot.  
Hint: Complete week 2 of the given course. 

It will look something like this:<br/>

While this may seem like a very limiting assignment, often in a game project you will have very tight constraints and strict limitations.
It will be the job of the artist to make creative and interesting decisions within those bounds.

## Review criteria
This assignment will be graded on the following criteria:
<li>Technical merit: The image must be no larger than 32x32 pixels, and use no more than 15 colors.
  The final result in unity has the right colors and number of pixels present.</li>
<li>Artistic Merit: The object must be identifiable as a barrel made of wood. Make clear and consistent use of color to create the illusion of light and shadows.</li>
<li>Creativity: Within the technical and artistic bounds of the assignment how creative can you get?
  Can you find a way to make it more than just a simple barrel and create something memorable within the constraint of the assignment?</li>
