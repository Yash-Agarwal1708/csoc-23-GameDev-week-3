## Task 2
Create a tiling set of assets needed to make a island-themed environment.
The tiles should each by 32x32 pixels in size, any background tiles or props may be larger. You should use no more than 30 or so colors across all of your background 
objects. Once you have made the core assets, use them to create a scene in unity depicting a island environment.  
Hint: Complete week 2 of the given course.

It will look something like this:<br/>

Like with the barrel asset assignment, see how you can use the constraints of the exercise to make creative and interesting choices. 
What the player might find in the environment is up to you. Coins? Treasure? A shipwreck? These decisions will create atmosphere for your game.  

## Review criteria
This assignment will be graded on the following criteria:
<li>Technical merit: The tiles must be no larger than 32x32 pixels, tile without seams, and use no more than 30 colors.
  The final result in unity has the right colors and number of pixels present.  Any props or background objects can be larger,
  but make sure it fits the style of the other assets.</li>
<li>Artistic Merit: The assets must clearly depict a island scene appropriate for a pirate themed game.
  Make clear and consistent use of color to create the illusion of light and shadows.
  When put together do the assets create a pleasant and descriptive scene?</li>
<li>Creativity: Within the technical and artistic bounds of the assignment how creative can you get?
  Can you find a way to make something memorable within the constraint of the assignment?</li>
